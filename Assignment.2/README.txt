Please use the assignment as delivered, there are three reasons for this:
	1. The java classes exist inside a package named "battleship" not the main package
	2. Given that the classes exist in package "battleship", so do their icon resources
	3. The icon resources have been named and therefore it must be this set of icons that's used with this code

But most importantly, use the resources directory attached as the code depends on the names of the icons.

All functionality has been implemented as stated in the assignment.
The two bonus objectives have both been met.
The code has been commented when needed to explain some non-intuitive code.
